## In this challenge, I have created an interactive dashboard that illustrates the dataset which has cataloged the microbes that colonize human navels. In this dataset, analysis reveals that there are a small handful of microbes (refered to as OTUs in the data) were present in 70% of the participants and others where very rarely found.

### There are a few major sections of this dashboard. First, fetching the data from the JSON dataset and reading it into the dropdown menu, the table, horizontal bar chart, and the bubble chart. Then, I intialized both of the charts so the data could be read into them. After that, I read in the metadata samples to be shown the table and then updated all of the different parts so they would change with the dropdown menu selection(s).


#### In this challenge utilized Stack Overflow and Chat GPT for some code syntax and debugging editing before submitting.
